## 3. NAEP

```{r}
n = 400
p1 = 0.85
q1 = 1 - p1
p2 = 0.77
q2 = 1 - p2
alpha = 0.13
z = qnorm(1 - (alpha / 2))
mu1 = n * p1
mu2 = n * p2
sigma1 = sqrt(n * p1 * q1)
sigma2 = sqrt(n * p2 * q2)
diff = mu1 - mu2
se_diff = sqrt((sigma1 ^ 2) / n + (sigma2 ^ 2) / n)
lb = diff - z * se_diff
percent_lb = lb / 400 * 100
ub = diff + z * se_diff
percent_ub = ub / 400 * 100

percent_lb
percent_ub
```

Using the normal approximation to the binomial, the 87% confidence interval for the true percentage drop is approx. [7.79%, 8.21%]. It's highly likely that there was a drop.

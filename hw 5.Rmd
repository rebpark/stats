## 1. Standardized test

men: n = 100, ybar = 500, s = 120

women: n = 100, ybar = 550, s = 110

```{r}
## difference of the means
diff = 550 - 500

## pooled estimate
sp = sqrt((99*(120^2) + 99*(100^2))/198)

## find the t-value
t = qt(.05, 198)

## margin of error, a=0.05, t=1.96
moe = t*sp*sqrt(.02)
moe
```

The 95% Confidence Interval is 50 Â± 25.814.
